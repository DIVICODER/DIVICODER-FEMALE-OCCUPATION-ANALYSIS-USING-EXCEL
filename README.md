# DIVICODER-FEMALE-OCCUPATION-ANALYSIS-USING-EXCEL

## Overview
In this project, I conducted data analysis using Excel to explore the potential occupations for females who have completed only a bachelor's degree. By cleaning and exploring the dataset, I used formulas, pivot tables, and charts to visualize the data and answer the following question:

**Question:** What occupations can females who have completed only a bachelor's degree choose according to region (North America, Pacific, and Europe)?

## Data Cleaning
Before conducting the analysis, I performed thorough data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. The cleaning process included:

- **Removing Whitespace:** Eliminated leading and trailing whitespace in text fields.
- **Removing Empty Rows:** Deleted rows with missing or empty values.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Removed duplicate entries to avoid redundancy.
- **Correcting Spellings:** Identified and corrected spelling errors in text fields.
- **Overcoming Double Spaces:** Replaced double spaces with single spaces to maintain consistency.

## Column Selection
To focus the analysis on relevant factors, I selected the necessary columns for creating pivot tables. The selected columns included:

- **Marital Status**
- **Gender**
- **Income**
- **Education**
- **Occupation**
- **Region**
- **Age**

## Insights
After thorough analysis using pivot tables and charts, the following insights were obtained:

- **Pacific Region:** Females in the Pacific region tend to choose professional roles.
- **Europe:** Females in Europe lean towards management positions.
- **North America:** In North America, females have diverse options, including both skilled work and management roles.

Additionally, an interesting trend emerged:

- **Age and Income:** Regardless of education level, females tend to have higher incomes as they age, highlighting the importance of experience in the workforce.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the intersection of education, gender, region, and occupation choices. By leveraging data analysis techniques in Excel, I gained a deeper understanding of the factors influencing career decisions for bachelor-educated females across different regions.
